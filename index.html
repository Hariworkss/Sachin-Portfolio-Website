      <h3> Sachin Tendulkar is an Indian Cricketer.The Initiation
        There are so many tales about how Tendulkar was introduced to cricket, we may never know the absolute truth. According to legend, his half-brother, Ajit, with whom Sachin \"lived the dream”, took him to Sharadashram School in Mumbai and introduced him to Ramakant Acharekar, his first coach, at the age of eleven in an effort to focus his energy on something productive.
        
        Since then, Tendulkar’s life was Eat, Sleep, Cricket.
        
        He changed schools, trained hard, played truckloads of matches, and soon, the name Sachin Tendulkar was famous across Mumbai. There was a whisper, whenever he was slated to bat in a school match, as crowds gathered to watch him bat. From a tender age, he would live up to the expectations too, as he famously scored 326* in a record-breaking partnership of 664 with Vinod Kambli - the highest partnership in any form of competitive cricket at the time.

        <h3>
          Tendulkar was made the captain of the side in 1996 at the age of 23, but with 7 years of experience behind him. A poor record, the egos of senior players to manage, and an avalanche of internal conflict, couldn’t quite dent Tendulkar’s performances with the bat, as he continued to score runs despite India being blanked by the opposition. In his second tenure as captain, which was thrust upon him without his contest, India lost a Test series to South Africa at home and Tendulkar’s own form was taking a hit, and he stepped down from captaincy. Sourav Ganguly took over as the leader in 2000, with the hopes of building a new Indian team amidst the match-fixing scandal that had taken the cricket world by storm.

            Back to business
            1998 was Tendulkar’s year as a batsman; a year when he played some of the most celebrated knocks in his career, including two of his most famous ODI innings. He scored a majestic 143 in the league stages of the Coca Cola Cup to get India into the final at Sharjah, and then scored 134 in the final against Australia to single-handedly take India past the finishing line. In the same year, he nearly pulled off another single-handed effort at Chennai, nearly pulling off a 4th innings chase against Pakistan whilst battling back spasms, before departing with India 17 runs short of victory. India went on to lose the match, but Tendulkar was the the man of the match for his breathtaking performance.
